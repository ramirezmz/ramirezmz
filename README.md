My name is Robertopaolo, I'm 24 years old, I'm married and father of a boy. <br />
I started my professional career as a developer in 2020, I overcame great challenges and the biggest learning I had was to create an application from scratch until it became a solution for many people <br />
I am currently a _Front-end developer_ and I have already provided services in an American company, which was fundamental to improve my technical and spoken English.
My purpose is to be able to contribute to companies and projects that transform people's lives and improve the world.
